### 🛠️ Made with:

This app is purposefuly built to **not** use classic 3rd party React components (such as react-leaflet, react-dnd, ...) to handle drag and drop or leverage mapping functionalities, hence only the following dependencies were used:

- [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for the maps and JS SDK
- [togpx](https://github.com/tyrasd/togpx) to convert geojson data into gpx data
- [AutoAnimate](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/) for the zero-config, drop-in animation utility
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for the icons used in the app
